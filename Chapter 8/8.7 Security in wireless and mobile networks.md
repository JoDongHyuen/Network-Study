Security in wireless and mobile networks
==============

<br/>

802.11 : authentication, encryption
-----------
* Arriving mobile must:
  1. associate with access point
  2. authenticate 절차를 거침

* more detail
  1. discovery of security capabilities
  2. mutual authentication(상호 검증) and shared symmetirc key derivation
     ```
     mobile과 Authentication Server 사이에 일어남
     ``` 
  3. shared symmetric session key distribution
     ```
     Authentication Server가 Access Point에게 key를 전송
     ```

4G / 5G
--------
* WiFi(802.11)이랑 비슷함
  
* Arriving mobile must:
  1. association with BS(Base Station)
  2. mutual authentication

* more detail
  1. authentication request to home network HSS
     ```
     Mobile -> Base Station -> MME -> Home Subscriber Service
     ``` 
  2. HSS가 얘는 서비스를 받아도 된다고 응답을 줌
  3. authentication response from mobile
     ```
     Mobile -> Base Station -> MME
     ```
  4. mobile is authenticated by network
     ```
     Mobile <- Base Station <- MME
     ``` 
  5. mobile 과 BS 간에 key derivation
